# AQI-forecating

We used LSTM model to forecasting 5 pollutants of a particular location
<ul>
  <li> Used dataset from National Air Quality Index - CPCB </li>
  <li>City selected is Jodhpur and time interval is 3.25 years from jan 2019 to march 2022</li>
  <li>Predicted conectration of all pollutant at next time stamp using values at previous 4 timestamps </li>
  <li>Used AQI formula to calulate AQI value</li>
  <li>Based AQI value, predicted the condition of air ranging from good to severe</li>
</ul>
